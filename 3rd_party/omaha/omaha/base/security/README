This directory contains a couple of stand-alone crypto implementations.

These implemenations have no Google3, stl or OpenSSL dependencies and
are endian-neutral.

The Android code base has code derived from this code, notably a
faster SHA version:
http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/system/core.git;a=tree;f=libmincrypt;hb=HEAD

As does ChromeOS.

Googlemac has selected libs at googlemac/opensource/update-engine/external.

Contact us in case you think you have a need for this code in your project.
