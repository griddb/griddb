## Overview
  GridDB has a KVS (Key-Value Store)-type data model that is suitable for sensor data stored in a timeseries. It is a database that can be easily scaled-out according to the number of sensors.

  * High Reliability  
    It is equipped with a structure to spread out the replication of key value data among fellow nodes so that in the event of a node failure, automatic failover can be carried out in a matter of seconds by using the replication function of other nodes.

  * High Performance (in-memory)  
   Even if the memory is increased to handle big data in a RDB, it is known that CPU power cannot be fully exploited and only around 10% of CPU resources are allocated to actual data processing due to the large overhead in buffer management, etc. Given the increase in memory size, GridDB minimizes the amount of overheads required previously by lightening the buffer process and recovery process, and by making it lock-free during data processing.

  * Advanced data model and operation model  
    In a traditional distributed KVS, data is handled using operations such as Put/Get/Remove. GridDB expands these functions greatly to support the definition function for organizational data, SQL-like query function, transaction function and Java API (Application Programming Interface) so that RDB users are able to introduce the system smoothly. The key value represents the data in a set of records known as a key container. This is similar to the relationship between a RDB table name and table. It is also equipped with an application function for sensor data management.

## Quick start
  When you install this package, a gsadm OS user are created in the OS.  
  Execute the operating command as a gsadm user.  
  We have confirmed the operation on CentOS 6.10 and 7.4.

### Start a server
    $ gs_passwd admin
      #input your_password
    $ vi conf/gs_cluster.json
      #    "clusterName":"your_clustername" #<-- input your_clustername
    $ export no_proxy=127.0.0.1
    $ gs_startnode
    $ gs_joincluster -c your_clustername -u admin/your_password

### Execute a sample program
    $ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:/usr/share/java/gridstore.jar
    $ mkdir gsSample
    $ cp /usr/griddb-X.X.X/docs/sample/program/Sample1.java gsSample/.
    $ javac gsSample/Sample1.java
    $ java gsSample/Sample1 239.0.0.1 31999 your_clustername admin your_password
      --> Person:  name=name02 status=false count=2 lob=[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]

    *: X.X.X is the GridDB version 

### Stop a server
    $ gs_stopcluster -u admin/your_password
    $ gs_stopnode -u admin/your_password
